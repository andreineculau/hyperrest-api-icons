# HyperREST API icons

This is a first quick go at creating a line of REST/HTTP icons based on [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/), but more important than the icons are the CSS class names (the icon API, if you will).

If you want to add or change CSS class names, [raise an issue](https://github.com/andreineculau/hyperrest-api-icons/issues/new).
If you create another line of icons following this naming pattern, I'll be happy to link to it. Raise an issue or make a pull request.

```css
/* CSS Usage */
@import url('//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/3.0.2/css/font-awesome.css');
@import url('//raw.github.com/andreineculau/hyperrest-api-icons/v0.0.1/hyperrest-api-icons.css');
```
